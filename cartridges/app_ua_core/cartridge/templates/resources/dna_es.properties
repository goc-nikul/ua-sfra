dna1.t1=EST. 1996
dna1.t2=THIS ISN'T A CINDERELLA STORY
dna1.t3=This is a story of hard work, grit, and the WILL to find a way. We started with one t-shirt to make all athletes better. Today, innovation is our lifeblood, and the key to delivering on our Brand Vision of Empowering Athletes Everywhere.

global.map=UA OFFICIALLY ENTERS

1996.t1.1=IT ALL STARTED WITH A SIMPLE IDEA:
1996.t1.2=BUILD A BETTER T-SHIRT.
1996.t2.1=PROTOTYPE 0037
1996.t2.2="THE SHORTY"
1996.t3.1=It was soft.
1996.t3.2=It was skin-tight.
1996.t3.3=And, most importantly, it wicked sweat 
1996.t3.4=faster than anything else out there.

2002.t1=WE MUST PROTECT THIS HOUSE.
2002.t2.1=WE CALLED OUT, “WILL YOU PROTECT THIS HOUSE?” 
2002.t2.2=THE ANSWER WAS LOUD & CLEAR: “I WILL.” 
2002.t2.3=ATHLETES AROUND THE WORLD HAD A NEW RALLYING CRY. 

2005.t2=WE WAGED A WAR AGAINST EVERYONE’S FAVORITE FABRIC: COTTON.
2005.t3=And introduced everyone’s new favorite performance fabric: UA TECH™.<br/>Engineered to feel more like cotton, but work like Under Armour.

2006.t1=CLICK-CLACK
2006.t2=IT’S OFFICIAL: OUR ATHLETES COULD NOW SUIT UP FROM HEAD TO TOE.

2011.t1=MOTHER NATURE MADE IT. WE MADE IT BETTER.
2011.t2.1=Here’s the breakdown: 
2011.t2.2=Charged Cotton
2011.t2.3=fabric is a unique blend of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fibers, which really means fibers that love water and fibers that hate it. The result is a game-changing fabric that absorbs sweat from your skin and then speeds it to the surface where it can evaporate faster. Way faster than ordinary cotton.<br/>You’re welcome.
2011.t3=Water Rolls Right Off.
2011.t4=It’s breathable, practically weightless, and keeps you dry. Now you have absolutely no excuses for staying inside.

2013.t1.1=COLDGEAR
2013.t1.2=INFRARED
2013.t2=STAY WARMER LONGER.
2013.t3=It’s the best insulation system we’ve ever created. A soft, thermo-conductive lining absorbs and retains your body heat, so you stay warmer longer…with no extra weight or bulk.

2014.t2=We’re not a campaign; not a season or snapshot. Our story isn’t told through a press release or social post. It's dripping down our backs—each drop a declaration to prove that the space between woman and athlete is no space at all.
2014.t4.1=If there was ever any doubt leading up to this point:
2014.t4.2=WE ARE A FOOTWEAR COMPANY.
2014.t4.3=We started with the world's first performance apparel for athletes, and returned there to create the first running shoe ever made in an apparel factory.

2015.t3=From the Brand that changed the way athletes dress comes the largest Connected Fitness platform in the world.
2015.t4=Get connected. Get inspired. Get better.

future.t1=THE FUTURE
future.t2=Innovation is our lifeblood. OUR JOB IS TO MAKE YOU BETTER.
future.t3=But it’s not just what we do, it’s who we are. It’s what gets us out of bed in the morning.<br/>And it is what will take us into the future.
